# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on [PracticePython](https://www.practicepython.org/) and also worked on developing my own Discord server bot!

**Thoughts:** I took a Udemy class on developing iOS apps and the programming ideas the course gave me were very handy in starting the development of the Discord bot. Reading documentation is really important when working with new API and also using new Python libraries.

### Day 1: November 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued development of Discord bot. Developed some understanding of Python AsyncIO.

**Thoughts:** This is the first time in awhile since I had felt some passion and excitement for coding. Still utilizing documentation from Discord to learn more about their API. I would like this Discord bot to be able to tell the weather when a user calls the !weather {zipcode} command. I've had some experience with a weather API in the past, so I think I can make this work.

### Day 2: November 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added !weather command to Discord bot. Learned about Python JSON parsing and accessing nested dictionaries.

**Thoughts:** My excitement was through the roof when I was able to get my !weather command working for the Discord bot. I still have some things I'd like to add. I'd also like to make a separate Python file for most, if not all, of the OpenWeatherMap API that's used in the weather command.
