# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on [PracticePython](https://www.practicepython.org/) and also worked on developing my own Discord server bot!

**Thoughts:** I took a Udemy class on developing iOS apps and the programming ideas the course gave me were very handy in starting the development of the Discord bot. Reading documentation is really important when working with new API and also using new Python libraries.

### Day 1: November 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued development of Discord bot. Developed some understanding of Python AsyncIO.

**Thoughts:** This is the first time in awhile since I had felt some passion and excitement for coding. Still utilizing documentation from Discord to learn more about their API. I would like this Discord bot to be able to tell the weather when a user calls the !weather {zipcode} command. I've had some experience with a weather API in the past, so I think I can make this work.

### Day 2: November 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added !weather command to Discord bot. Learned about Python JSON parsing and accessing nested dictionaries.

**Thoughts:** My excitement was through the roof when I was able to get my !weather command working for the Discord bot. I still have some things I'd like to add. I'd also like to make a separate Python file for most, if not all, of the OpenWeatherMap API that's used in the weather command.

### Day 3: November 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cleaning up code, seperating OpenWeatherMap API and SmartyStreets API into different Python files for cleanliness.

**Thoughts:** I haven't implemented anything particularly new to the Discord bot today. The !weather {postal_code} takes in the postal code instead of a city now. This provides more accuracy, but the command is now only limited to the US. The command will now display the current weather conditions (snow, rain, thunder, etc.) instead of just cloudiness levels. Moving things into a seperate Python file helps a lot with readability. Rather than using the pyowm library, I have decided to use the JSON data parsed from the API. I've also used SmartyStreets for location purposes.

### Day 4: November 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up some more code in my Discord bot, made the output of the !weather command cleaner.

**Thoughts:** I got started a little late on my Discord bot today because of some schoolwork, but I managed to clean up most of the code and added wind and humidity info for my !weather {zipcode} command. Once I’m satisfied, I’ll be taking a look at playing music with the bot!

### Day 5: November 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began algorithm practice on Hackerrank, looked at YouTube API for !play command with Discord bot

**Thoughts:** I was watching William Lin on YouTube and saw his competitive programming videos, so I figured I'd try and give Hackerrank a shot since algorithms are really important in computer science and it could also help me develop some crucial skills as a developer. I'm also looking to add a !play {music} command to my Discord bot, so I've been exploring the YouTube API a bit.

### Day 6: November 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More algorithm practice on Hackerrank.

**Thoughts:** Today was a bit of a slower day since I had a lot of schoolwork to catch up and finish, so I just did an hour of algorithm problem solving on Hackerrank. Nothing too big, but it does make me feel more confident about my ability to use Python. I'm going to look into getting back into C++ in the next few days.
