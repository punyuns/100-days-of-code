# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on [PracticePython](https://www.practicepython.org/) and also worked on developing my own Discord server bot!

**Thoughts:** I took a Udemy class on developing iOS apps and the programming ideas the course gave me were very handy in starting the development of the Discord bot. Reading documentation is really important when working with new API and also using new Python libraries.
